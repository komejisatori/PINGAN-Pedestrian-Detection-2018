# Pedestrian Detection Analysis Tools

> Those codes include Elemental Data Analysis and Result Analysis tools.

## List

* [Bounding Box Label](bbox_label.py)
> Label images with bouding box. Put the images into a dir called `img` in this folder.

* [Bounding Box Viewer](bbox_viewer.py)
> Given a submission format file result, draw bounding box on the original images.

* [Draw Detectron Training Processing Graph](evaluate_training.py)
> Given a detectron trainning prcessing log file, output the training loss graph via time.

* [Brightness & Area Analysis](bright_area_analysis)
> Given a submission format result file, draw the grpah with brightness and area analysis.

* [Overlap Bounding Box Analysis](overlap_analysis)
> Given the ground truth of bounding box, output the overlap result.

* [WIDER Evaluation Tools](wider_evaluate)
> Official WIDER Competition Evaluation Tools and draw the AP and Precision-Recall Graph.
